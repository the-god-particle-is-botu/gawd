<h1>calculation of best fit line<h1>
<br>
Hi guys,
I am Rohith from mechanical 2020😁
As all of us are facing a problem in making best fit line calculations tbh we are lazy😉 so i have made a code which computes all the values of required to make that table even the numerator and denominator of the slope will be calculated u just have to divide and calculate slope. Calculating the slope is not the point we face difficulties in writing the big table.
It is a simple code 😅 but ig it would be useful.
So copy the code in the text given below and paste in the recommended compiler to avoid segmentation fault.
